R3DLIN3 Flappy Bird Mobile
=========
Initially, I wanted to try recreating Flappy Bird in HTML5, using a canvas and recycling the assets from the old game.

What I did instead is something way more primitive. This project uses nothing but good ol' div's for all the objects and graphics, will scale perfectly on almost any screen (mobile and desktop), is terribly unoptimized, laggy, and isn't nearly as fast as it would've been if I had just used a canvas instead. But here it is!
